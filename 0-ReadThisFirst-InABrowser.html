    For the Paper-and-Pencil part of the exam,
    the only external resource
    that you may use is THREE (one-sided) 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper,
    with whatever you want on them (printed or handwritten).

    The exam will assess your ability to trace by hand code that includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    WHILE loops, in both the <em>while True</em> and <em>while
    condition</em> forms.
    </li>
    <li>
    Simple loops within loops.
    </li>
    <li>
    A class definition and code that constructs multiple instances
    of that class, accesses their instance variables,
    and calls their methods.
    (This will require that you include a box-and-pointer diagram.)
    </li>
    <li>
    Code that has a function whose arguments include container objects
    that are mutated within the function.
    (This will require that you include a box-and-pointer diagram.)
    </li>
    </ul>
